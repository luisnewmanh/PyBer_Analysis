The summary allows us to identify that urbans commutes are where the bulk of the business is concentrated. There are more rides and drivers at Urban locations; howeve it  can be seen that the average ride is shorter and therefore the average fare is lower. On the same line, on average the fare per driverfor the urban market is 3.35 lower compared to the rural.

There is nota lot of variation through the three different markets. More data is needed to determine if all markets continue to grow at the same pace.
## Summary
