## Results
### Ride-sharing Summary

The summary allows us to identify that urbans commutes are where the bulk of the business is concentrated. There are more rides and drivers at Urban locations; howeve it  can be seen that the average ride is shorter and therefore the average fare is lower. On the same line, on average the fare per driverfor the urban market is 3.35 lower compared to the rural. 
### Weekly Fares for Each City Type

There is not a lot of variation through the weekly fares of for each city type. The three series show a positive trend; however more data is needed to determine if all markets continue to grow at the same pace.
## Summary
- Despite looking good in the summary, the rural market should be considered with caution. This market only represents 6.8% of the total fares from the business, expanding agressively might be high risk <img src="https://github.com/luisnewmanh/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/Analysis/Total_fares.PNG"> 
- Drivers in urban cities on average have more rides and less compensation than rural and the difference is even greater compared to rural. Does the compensation system for the drivers considers this trend? <img src="https://github.com/luisnewmanh/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/Analysis/Fig1.png">
- Data is accurate and only one outlier is found in the whole analysis at the city of West Angela (Urban market), data results can be trusted <img src="https://github.com/luisnewmanh/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/Analysis/Fig2.png">
